  This paper outlines the design and deployment of
  BoilerBot: a task-oriented multi- modal conversational
  agent developed for the Alexa Prize TaskBot 2 competition.
  BoilerBot features flexible response generation,
  leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enable
  adaptable user experiences. We discuss our novel
  contributions towards advancing state-of-the-art
  task-oriented conversational agents, highlighting
  user-facing challenges and proposing fault-tolerant,
  iterative solutions for carefully guided workflows that
  enable Alexa users to maximize BoilerBotâ€™s functionality.
